# Maven Project Generator

## Overview

This Maven Project Generator streamlines development by allowing you to quickly create a fully functional Maven project with minimal setup. Simply specify the module name and table name to generate a complete Maven project with foundational code, common methods, and essential configurations.

## Key Features

- **Quick Module Setup**: Generate an independent Maven project by providing only the module name and table name.
- **Automated Base Code**: The generated project includes basic CRUD operations, database mappings, and essential utility classes.
- **Reusable Methods and API Endpoints**: Pre-defined service methods and API endpoints are included, making it easy to extend and customize.
- **Visual Dashboard**: The generator includes a visual dashboard where you can select tables and generate code with just a few clicks.
- **Immediate Start**: The generated project is fully configured and ready for immediate use, letting you jump directly into coding and testing.

## Requirements

- JDK 1.8 or higher
- Maven 3.5 or higher
- MySQL Database

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### Step 2: Launch the Visual Dashboard

Open the visual dashboard to select the desired tables and quickly generate code. Follow the prompts on the dashboard to complete the setup.

### Step 3: Configure Database Connection

Update the database configuration in `application.properties` to connect to your MySQL database:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

### Step 4: Build and Run the Project

Use Maven to build and run the project:
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Project Structure

The generated project includes the following structure:

- **`src/main/java`**: Contains the generated Java source code, organized by package.
- **`src/main/resources`**: Contains configuration files, including `application.properties` for database settings.
- **`pom.xml`**: Maven configuration file with dependencies for Spring Boot, MySQL, and other essentials.

## Customization

You can easily extend and customize the generated code by adding additional methods, endpoints, or modifying the base configurations according to your requirements.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, refer to the generated logs or verify that the database configuration is correct. For common issues, check the FAQ or open an issue in the repository.
